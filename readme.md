How to setup this ?
1- Start the app; Click "Config"; Click "As a server"; And Click "Ok". That's all for this one.
2- Get the server ip adress using cmd ( Open The command line and type "ipconfig" to get your ipv4 public adress. ( The bottom one ))
3- Start the app ( don't close the server window ); Click "Config"; Click "As a guest"; And Change
	 the "Ip adress" field to the server ip adress you got with "ipconfig" command.
4- Setup an other client who is connected to the same network as you with the same Ip Adress
5- Come back to the main window, and click to Group Chat.
6- When you're done chating, you can just quit the app and close the server too. But remember, the server has to be created first,
	and closed last.
Enjoy!
